"""Scope test for the embedded-terminal shell tool's working_directory.

The tool used to pass `working_directory` straight through to
`subprocess.Popen(cwd=...)`. An LLM-supplied path of '/etc' or '..' would
spawn a subprocess outside `jupyter_root_dir`. These tests pin the
``_get_safe_path`` gate that now blocks that traversal.
